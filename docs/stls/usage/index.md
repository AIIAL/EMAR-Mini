# Introduction

This tutorial will prepare you for printing your EMAR Mini V1. The STLs provided have been created by Association Alumni - [Jose Mario Garza](https://www.leukemiaresearchassociation.ai/team/jose-mario-garza "Jose Mario Garza"), he also 3D printed the office version of EMAR Mini in his lab in Mexico.

__This project is a work in progress, we are in the process of modifying the STLs to allow for full functionality.__

# Start Printing

![Start Printing](../../img/stls.png)

Now it is time to start printing. The provided [STL files](https://github.com/AIIAL/EMAR-Mini/blob/main/stls/) should work on any 3D printer. Load the files into your 3D printing software and print each model.

&nbsp;

# Continue
At this point you now have your Raspberry Pi ready and the 3D printed parts. Continue to the [hardware guide](../../rpi4/hardware/rpi4.md) to complete the assembly of your EMAR Mini.
